3. **Alert Types**:
   - Weather alerts (daily forecasts and severe weather warnings)
   - Crop health/disease alerts (based on weather conditions and crop types)
   - Market price alerts (price changes for crops)
4. **User Preferences** - Frontend settings panel for users to customize their alert preferences

   - Verify the Python version (3.8+ required)

3. **Alerts not triggering**:
   - Check if the alert preferences are enabled in the user profile
   - Verify the API URLs in the scheduler configuration
   - Test the alert endpoints manually using Postman or similar tools
